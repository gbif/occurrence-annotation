## Submission notes

This is the first submission of gbifrules to CRAN.

The package provides an R interface to the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) rule-based annotation API, allowing users to create, manage, and apply community-curated data quality rules to occurrence datasets.

Note: Tests are skipped on CRAN as they require a live backend service connection.
